Basically, program takes A.txt and b.txt and gives outputs in the output.txt .
You need to put source.cpp and txt files in the same folder.
In the given example, the matrix A has high condition numbers so the small change in the b generates a huge change in x.
x1:
2
0
x2:
1
1
A matrix's condition numbers are 4004,001. However, my program gives 4004 because of the machine precision. Nevertheless, it is much more than 1. Therefore, there are such changes.
